A swap is a derivative contract through which two parties exchange the cash flows or liabilities from two different financial instruments. One cash flow is generally fixed, while the other is variable and based on a benchmark interest rate. Given the features of the legs, the purpose of the current calculator is to determine the spread for the first leg to equal both present values.

The calculation relies in a rate curves file, where the forecasting for the basis rate are concentrated for the next 10 years (This file is usually provided for a price supplier, an agent in charge of perform realiable forecasting in a daily basis)
